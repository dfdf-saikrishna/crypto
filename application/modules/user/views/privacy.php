<h3>B. Protecting Your Information </h3>
  Keeping your information secure is one of  our most important responsibilities. We maintain physical, electronic and  procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect your  information. We limit access to client information to those employees and  others who have a business reason to know this information. We maintain strict  internal policies against unauthorized disclosure or use of client information.

  <h3>C.    Information Sharing With Third Parties </h3>
  Individuals or companies outside the Crypto2Bank  group of companies are considered third parties. We will not share your  information with third parties so they may market their products to you.  Accordingly, you do not need to tell us to refrain from sharing your  information with third parties.

  •You may direct us not to share information  about your creditworthiness received from you or others (such as information  from your application or your employment or credit history) within our Group of  Companies.

    Protect your PINs and other passwords. Do not  share them with anyone unless it’s for a service or transaction you request,  and you are confident the other party will protect the information as you  would.
    Carry only the minimum amount of  identifying information you require.
    Check account statements carefully to  ensure all charges, checks or withdrawals are authorized.
    If you believe you are a victim of identity  theft, take immediate action and keep records of your conversations and  correspondence. While the steps you must take will vary with your individual  circumstances, four basic actions are appropriate in almost every case:
    1.Contact the fraud departments in your  country of origin to place a fraud alert on your credit file.
    2.Contact the creditors for any accounts  that have been tampered with or opened fraudulently.
    3.File a report with your local police or  the police in the community where the identity theft took place, and get a copy  of the police report.
    4.File a complaint with the Trade  Commission in your country of origin or in the community where the crime took  place, and get a copy of the report.  </li>
